# Atari-Breakout-Emulator
An attempt at programming Atari's Classic game Breakout!

# Motivation
I wanted to see how a simple game like Atari's Breakout can be recreated in JavaScript. I am currently learning JavaScript, and this game helps me with splitting things into "factories" along with learning how a ball can "bounce" between different objects in the game (either a brick or the paddle).

# Tech Stack
I used JavaScript to manipulate the main canvas element, but I also used some HTML for basic setup and CSS for styling and formatting.
